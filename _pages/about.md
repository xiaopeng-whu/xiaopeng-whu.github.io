<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Wuhan University, advised by Xiaochuan Shi and Chao Ma. I am also an intern of BeingBeyond founded by Zongqing Lu.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Cyber Science and Engineering at Wuhan University, advised by Xiaochuan Shi. After two years of master's studies, I chose to pursue a doctorate through a Successive Postgraduate and Doctoral Program.

My research interest includes reinforcement learning and robotics.
