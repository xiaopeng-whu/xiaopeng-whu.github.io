<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Wuhan University](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/), advised by [Xiaochuan Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o6CFxvoAAAAJ) and [Chao Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KxM9fukAAAAJ). I am also an intern of [BeingBeyond](https://github.com/BeingBeyond) founded by [Zongqing Lu](https://z0ngqing.github.io/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Cyber Science and Engineering at Wuhan University, advised by Xiaochuan Shi. After two years of master's studies, I chose to pursue a doctorate through a Successive Postgraduate and Doctoral Program.

My research interest includes reinforcement learning and robotics.
